This FiveM safezone script provides a flexible solution for server administrators to create safe areas within their server environment. By defining coordinates and radius, administrators can establish zones where players are protected from attacks and weapon usage. The script also allows for certain jobs to be exempted from these restrictions, providing flexibility in gameplay dynamics.

Instructions:

Define Safezones: Modify the safezones table in the Lua script to specify the coordinates (x, y, z) and radius of each safezone.
Configure Allowed Jobs: Update the allowedJobs table to include the names of jobs allowed to use weapons within safezones.
Integration with QBCore: Ensure the QBCore resource is installed and configured to manage player jobs.
Integration with okokNotify: Make sure the okokNotify resource is installed to display notification messages when players enter or exit safezones.
